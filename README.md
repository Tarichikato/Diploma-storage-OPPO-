Diploma storage (OPPO)

Our smart contract to register the validity of diplomas on the Ethereum blockchain is contract/DiplomaStorage.sol

This code is a beta version of our product. 
The structure representing a student in the smart contract contains an unused field: faceHash.
Eventually this field will represent the coordinates of the student's face according to the vectors of a facial recognition method.
